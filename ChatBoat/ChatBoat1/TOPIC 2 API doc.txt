Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is a vaginal infection which is caused by the overgrowth of these bacteria which naturally occur in your vagina. BV is a commonly occuring infection and can have many underlying causes - having multiple sex partners or a new sex partner, using unnatural cleaning agents to clean your vagina (douching), and generally lacking lactobacilli (the good) bacteria. Getting rid of BV is really simple though so not to panic :)",

It is a vaginal suppository (you insert it in your vagina and it dissolves into a cream - typically done overnight) made of Clindamycin, Clotrimazole and Tinidazole. Doctors prescribe this because it generally fights both bacterial as well as fungal infections in your vagina! You may also be prescribed any vaginal suppository containing metronidazole and clindamycin. These may also be prescribed in oral form if your menstrual cycle may come in the middle of the course!"

Your vagina is self cleaning so you do not need to use any artificial agents to clean your vagina! Eat plenty of curds and greek yogurt as these contain lactobacilli - the good bacteria to keep your vagina healthy!"
