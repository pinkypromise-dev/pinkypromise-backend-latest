According to the Mayo Clinic, nearly all sexually active people will become infected with at least one type of human papilloma virus during their lifetime. There are a large variety of genital warts - more than 40 strains, which affect the genital area. Often, HPV infections are asymptomatic but some strains of HPV can lead to cervical cancer as well as cancers of the anus, penis, and mouth. Genital warts Are typically brown or pink in color, but sometimes they can be so small and flat against the skin, that they can be invisible "
